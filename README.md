# Icon-Maker
An Xcode 9 App Icon Set Generator

This is a Python Web App made with Flask and Pillow , you can check this out at hernanpaez.com/iconresizer

## Why?

I've been using a lot of third party icon generators for my iOS projects but many of them are expensive apps or webpages that require you to open an account and/or provide an email address. Therefore, most of this apps doesn't work nice with Xcode 9 and generates icons sets with missing icon sizes.
